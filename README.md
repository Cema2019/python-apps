# Python Apps Collection

This repository contains a growing collection of Python scripts and small applications, built for learning, experimentation, and practical automation.

## Overview

The apps in this repository will cover a range of topics and use cases, such as:
- Data processing and transformation
- File and image manipulation
- Web scraping and downloading
- Utility scripts (e.g., password generators, automation tools)
- Experimentation with libraries like pandas, sqlite3, tkinter, and more.

Each script is self-contained in its own folder and may have its own README file for details.

## Repository Structure

Example folder layout:
```

```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cema2019/python-apps.git
```

2. Navigate to the desired app's folder and read its README for setup and usage instructions.

3. Run the Python script (Python 3.x recommended):
```bash
python script_name.py
```

## Status

This repository is still **incomplete** and under active development. More apps will be added over time as part of ongoing learning and experimentation.
